- Rules of the game:
    - Goal of the game is to add up to the largest number without going over **21**
    - If the card in your hand adds up to more than **21**, it's called a Bust causing immediate lose.
    - **Jack**, **Queen** and **King**, all are considered or counted as number **10**
    - **Ace** is normally counted as **11** but if you're scoring 20 and showing up an ace, then it's counted as **1**
- About the game:
    - At the start, both players, here as represented by the AI and the player, are given two cards.
    - AI's one card is shown to you while other remains hidden.
    - Your own cards are visible to you.
    - Either you can ask the dealer to given one more card or pass the opportunity.
    - If you pass the opportunity then dealer shows you their card:
        - If either of you have score less than 17 then you have to take a card
        - Or, if you pass: whichever player's score is higher and below 21 wins.
        - If both score 20, then it is a draw
        - If either goes over 21, the other player wins
