# Secret Auctions Program🔐🤫
## Description:
- It's an auction where we don't tell who's the highest bidder, it's just luck if a particular person wins.
- In this way, no ones guesses if the bid is going higher. So no competition since no one knows who's winning
- ```Uses Dictionary method to store the records and in the end uses a function to get the maximum bid from the record.```
